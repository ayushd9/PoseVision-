‚ú® Project Description ‚Äì PoseVision


PoseVision is a real-time human pose tracking and joint-angle analysis tool that transforms your webcam into an intelligent motion tracker. Using MediaPipe's powerful pose estimation, combined with OpenCV for real-time video processing and NumPy for vector math, it detects 33 body landmarks and computes key joint angles like elbows, shoulders, hips, and knees ‚Äî all live and visually overlaid on the video stream.

Whether you're building a smart fitness coach, exploring gesture-based interaction, or analyzing biomechanics for research, PoseVision provides an intuitive and extensible platform. It's lightweight, easy to set up, and delivers high performance ‚Äî ideal for developers, researchers, or anyone interested in computer vision and human-computer interaction.
